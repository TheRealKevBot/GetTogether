# GetTogether
Tired of trying to make plans all through group chats? 

Now an app devoted towards making plans and keeping them!

## General Info
This web based app allows users to sign-up and create an account with us. Our home page or feed gives a remarkably similar feel to that of Facebook and Instagram. Your events or plans are listed within your feed showing you all pertinent details such time, date, location, as well as a description if the event is public. This keeps everything nice and organized! As an added bonus there is also a chat feature for plans, so that your group chat's can stay random and irrelevant! 

## Inspiration
My main driving force for creating this project is mainly due to the fact that group chats for my friends group can get off topic very easily and stay that way considering there are over ten of us in the group. I find that it is very difficult after someone suggests something to even scroll up and find it buried in everything else that we talk about. This provides an easy and clear way to make plans and have separate discussions about them!
